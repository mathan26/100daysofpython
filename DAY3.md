## Conditional Flow

**if**
**else**

 1. Intendation is important.
 2. **:** at the end

Example:	   

		    if number % 2 ==0:
    	    print("This is an even number.")
    	    else:
    	    print("This is an odd number.")
**elif**

 - use between if and else to check other condition.
 - multiple conditions use **and** in between.
 Example:
 

	      if bmi < 18.5:
	       print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")

**Multiple If Statements in Succession**
you can use multiple if to check the multiple condition
make sure the indentation.

**Logical Operators**
Check multiple conditions in the same line of code.

 - and
 - or
 - not
**mulitiline print**
  Use Three Single Quotes: ('''  ''')   

	     print(''' 
	    			      this is mulliline 
	    			      word
	    			      ''')
Escape the " or  ' quotes by  \ before
